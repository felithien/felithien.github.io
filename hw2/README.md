##### *Grid with Octagon Shape :*
Octagon shape was created by using square shape as the initial shape and adding one more shape (which looks like trapezoid) at the top and bottom part of the square. 
This shape was achieved by changing the size of the left and right border of its shape, and using the same color with the background page (use the same color only for left and right border)
And to change the slope of the octagon, slightly change the size of the left and right border.
