# 前端程式設計期末專題 : 來認識印尼料理 :D

##### FRONTEND PROGRAMMING FINAL PROJECT : LET'S RECOGNIZE INDONESIAN CUISINE



## GOALS :

The aim of this project is users could recognize and learn more about the name of Indonesia traditional cuisine. 



## INTRODUCTION :

It is divided into three sections :

* *Introduction* : every cuisine has its own description, and users can click on "ADD TO MY FAVORITE" to create their own learning or reviewing card.
* *Try* : users may challenge themselves whether they remember the name of the cuisine of not.
* *My favorite* : users can find and remove their learning card here. 



## TECHNICS :

* ##### CSS :
  * Overall, I'm using Bootstrap components.
  * For hover effects, I'm using the code from : https://hackmd.io/@F2Cp__R2Tx-MijlydKtHyA/B1GRej5pN

* ##### JavaScript / jQuery:

  - Basically, this project used "hide" and "show" effects.
  - For the tab menu in navigation bar, "add" and "remove" class effects were used.

  - For the random picture in the part "Try", I'm using the code from : http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2239154&seqNum=10 with small changes.
